## 📝 JavaScript Loops Worksheet

### Instructions:
- Answer each question based on your understanding of `for`, `while`, and `do...while` loops in JavaScript.
- Questions progress from **easy** to **hard**.
- Write code where required and briefly explain your reasoning.

---

### **Easy (1-4)**

**1.**  
Write a `for` loop that prints the numbers from 1 to 5 (inclusive).

---

**2.**  
What will be the output of this code?
```javascript
let i = 3;
while (i > 0) {
  console.log(i);
  i--;
}
```

---

**3.**  
Fill in the blanks to complete this `do...while` loop so it prints `0 1 2`:
```javascript
let n = 0;
do {
  console.log(n);
  n++;
} while (__________);
```

---

**4.**  
True or False:  
A `while` loop will always execute its body at least once.  
_Explain your answer._

---

### **Medium (5-7)**

**5.**  
Rewrite this `for` loop as a `while` loop:
```javascript
for (let i = 10; i > 5; i--) {
  console.log(i);
}
```

---

**6.**  
What is the output of the following code? Explain why.
```javascript
let x = 5;
do {
  console.log(x);
  x++;
} while (x < 5);
```

---

**7.**  
Write a `for` loop that prints all **even numbers** from 2 to 10 (inclusive).

---

### **Hard (8-10)**

**8.**  
Write a `while` loop that sums all numbers from 1 to 100 and prints the result.

---

**9.**  
What is the difference between a `while` loop and a `do...while` loop? Give an example where this difference is visible.

---

**10.**  
Write a `for` loop that prints the numbers from 10 down to 1, but **stops early** if the number is divisible by 4 (use `break`).

---

### ✅ **Bonus:**
Try to answer all questions without running the code first. Then test your answers in a JavaScript environment to check your understanding!
