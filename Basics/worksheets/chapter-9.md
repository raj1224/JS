**5.**  
Write code to check if the string `"JavaScript"` contains the substring `"Script"`[6].

---

**6.**  
How do you convert the string `"hello world"` to uppercase[6]?

---

**7.**  
What does the `trim()` method do to a string[5][6]?

**8.**  
What is the difference between `slice()` and `substring()` for strings[5][6]?

---

**9.**

---

**10.**

```


---

**11.**  
How do you split the string `"red,green,blue"` into an array of colors[5][6]?

---

**12.**

---

**13.**  
How do you replace the first occurrence of `"cat"` with `"dog"` in the string `"cat and cat"`[6]?

---

console.log(str.repeat(3));
```
_Explain your answer[6]._

---

### **Hard (15‚Äì20)**

**15.**  
Write a function that returns `true` if a given input is a string, and `false` otherwise[1].

---

**16.**  
Given `let str = "  hello world  ";`, write code to remove only the whitespace at the start of the string[6].

---

**17.**  
How do you pad the string `"5"` on the left with zeros so that it becomes `"005"`[6]?

---

**18.**  
Given a string `let s = "üòä";`, what will `s.length` return and why[6]?

---

**19.**  
Write code to convert the string `"hello world"` to `"Hello World"` (capitalize the first letter of each word).  
_Hint: Use `split()`, `map()`, and `join()`._

---

**20.**  
Explain why the following code returns `false`, and how you could fix it:  
```js
let x = "John";
let y = new String("John");
console.log(x === y);
```
