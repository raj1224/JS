## üìù Variables and Data Types Worksheet

### Instructions:
- Answer the following questions based on your understanding of variable declarations and data types in JavaScript.
- Questions are arranged from **easy** to **hard**.
- Write code where required and explain your reasoning briefly.

---

### **Easy (1-4)**

**1.**  
Which keyword would you use to declare a variable whose value will never change?  
a) `var`  
b) `let`  
c) `const`  

---

**2.**  
What will be the output of this code?  
```js
console.log(x);
var x = 5;
```
_Explain your answer._

---

**3.**  
Is the following code valid? Why or why not?  
```js
let a = 10;
let a = 20;
```

---

**4.**  
Identify the data type of each variable:  
```js
let name = "Bob";
let score = 99;
let isActive = false;
let nothing = null;
let notDefined;
```

---

### **Medium (5-7)**

**5.**  
What is the difference between `let` and `var` in terms of scope?

---

**6.**  
What will be the output of this code?  
```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr.push(4);
console.log(arr);
```
_Can you explain why this is allowed, even though `arr` is a `const`?_

---

**7.**  
Write code to demonstrate the difference between **primitive** and **reference** assignment.

---

### **Hard (8-10)**

**8.**  
What will this code print? Explain why.
```js
let a = { value: 5 };
let b = a;
b.value = 10;
console.log(a.value);
```

---

**9.**  
Is this code valid? Why or why not?  
```js
const x;
x = 10;
```

---

**10.**  
Which of the following are **primitive types** in JavaScript?  
a) String  
b) Object  
c) Boolean  
d) Array  
e) BigInt  
f) Function
