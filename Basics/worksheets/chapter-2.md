## 📝 JavaScript Operators Worksheet

### Instructions:
- Answer the following questions based on your understanding of operands, operators, and the different types of operators in JavaScript.
- Questions are arranged from **easy** to **hard**.
- Write code where required and explain your reasoning briefly.

---

### **Easy (1-4)**

**1.**  
In the expression `8 * 4`, identify the operands and the operator.

---

**2.**  
What will be the value of `x` after this code runs?
```js
let x = 10;
x += 5;
```

---

**3.**  
What is the result of this comparison:  
```js
7 == "7"
```
_Explain your answer._

---

**4.**  
Write a JavaScript statement that checks if a number `n` is **not** equal to `10` (using strict comparison).

---

### **Medium (5-7)**

**5.**  
What does the following code output? Why?
```js
let a = 3;
let b = 2;
console.log(a > 2 && b = 50) {
  result = "Pass";
} else {
  result = "Fail";
}
```

---

**7.**  
What is the value of `msg` after this code executes?
```js
let msg = "Hello";
msg += " World!";
```

---

### **Hard (8-10)**

**8.**  
What will this code print? Explain your answer.
```js
console.log(typeof "123");
console.log(typeof 123);
```

---

**9.**  
Write a statement that checks if `arr` is an array using an operator.

---

**10.**  
What is the output of this code? Why?
```js
let x = 5;
let y = "5";
console.log(x === y);
console.log(x == y);
```

---

### ✅ **Bonus:**
Try to answer all questions without running the code first. Then test your answers in a JavaScript environment to check your understanding!
